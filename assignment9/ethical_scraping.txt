Websites use robots.txt files to communicate with web crawlers and instruct them on which parts of the site they are permitted or forbidden to access. 
Its primary purpose is to manage crawler traffic, prevent server overload, and avoid the indexing of private, irrelevant, or duplicate content by search engines. 
By respecting these directives, robots.txt promotes ethical scraping by allowing website owners to define boundaries and ensuring that automated access is conducted in a responsible and non-intrusive manner.
