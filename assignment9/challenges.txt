Challenges I faced:
Initially, I tried using an absolute XPath for just the first item, which only returned one result. I mistakenly used find_element instead of find_elements for all list items. There was confusion around accessing the correct child <a> and <strong> tags.

How I resolved them:
- I used browser DevTools to inspect the HTML structure and found that all 10 items are inside the second <ul> under #sec-main.
- I used find_elements to loop through each <li> element.
- I used TAG_NAME to get the <a> tag and extracted both text and href.
